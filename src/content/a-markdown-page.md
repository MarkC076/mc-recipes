  After a little inspiration from GBBO and a small talk over lunch, my
  colleagues and I at ITC organised ourselves our own little charity event to
  raise money for British Heart Foundation. With 14 bakers, many tasters and an
  ounce of competition (that some may say was fixed), we managed to raise
  £226.42 over 3 days for the amazing cause.

After a little inspiration from GBBO and a small talk over lunch, my colleagues and I at ITC organised ourselves our own little charity event to raise money for British Heart Foundation.

With 14 bakers, many tasters and an ounce of competition (that some may say was fixed), we managed to raise £226.42 over 3 days for the amazing cause.

I think the whole office ‘felt sick’ for 3 days, as quoted by many. Nevertheless, it was lots of fun and nice to see the whole office getting involved.

I have no doubt that there will be another next year, with many wanting to take the title off Big Boss Stuart!

Thanks again team!
