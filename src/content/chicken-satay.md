Peel the ginger and help them to finely grate it and tip it into a bowl. Repeat with the garlic and lime zest. Halve the lime and juice it, then mix it in a bowl with the honey, soy, curry powder and peanut butter. Give it a good mix, adding a small splash of water if it’s too stiff, then spoon two-thirds of the mix into a small pan. Set aside for Step 4.

Put the chicken in the sandwich bag, one breast at a time, flatten each one with a rolling pin or a meat mallet – this isn’t essential.

Mix the chicken with the marinade you made. Cut the chicken into strips, tip it into the remaining third of the peanut-butter mix, stir well. Cover with cling film and chill until required. This can be done up to 3 hrs ahead.

While the chicken is marinating, pour the coconut milk into the pan and stir together with the peanut butter mix. The sauce needs to be heated gently and stirred.

The chicken needs to be threaded into ‘S’ shapes onto the skewers.

Heat the grill to high and brush a baking tray with oil. Grill the skewers for about 10 mins, turning occasionally, until lightly charred.

Make cucumber ribbons with a peeler. Using a swivel-blade peeler, peel the cucumber into a bowl, then carry on peeling the cucumber flesh into ribbons until you get to the seeds. Repeat with each side of the cucumber.

Mix a dressing for the cucumber. Mix the vinegar and sugar until the sugar dissolves. Add the sweet chilli, if using, then pour over the cucumber. Add coriander. To serve, put the skewers on a platter, the sauce and salad in bowls, and serve with rice and lime wedges on the side.
